# simple-oximetry

this repository contains the project files of me and my friend simple oximetry project 
in microprocesor system class during our undergraduate study

It is an experiment and implementation of a device to measure the activity of a person's 
oxygen saturation level. we conduct the experiment by using real person data using photodiode and IR sensor.

The file in this repository will also includes some of the basic concepts steps below:
- digital filtering
- analog to digital converter (ADC)
- digital to analog converter (DAC)
- analog filter circuit design
- final experiment and implementation code

Thank you
